# Computational neuroscience tutorial

This is git for tutorial used for my lectures on computational neuroscience.


## Computational models of neural codes
Understanding how information is encoded and stored in neural circuits is one of the fundamental problems in brain science. This course will introduce a number of basic neural coding models, first focusing on the fly olfactory system and then extend the topics to other systems. The course is designed so that students would need to have minimal prior background in neuroscience to take this course.
 
## About the course
This course provides an introduction to basic sensory processing in the drosophila olfactory system as an example for understanding how different neural codes operate and what may be their circuit basis. We will explore the computational principles governing the different stages of information processing, e.g. encoding and learning. Specific topics that will be covered include: representation of information by spiking neurons, processing of information in neural networks, and neural models for learning. We will make use of Matlab demonstrations and exercises to gain a deeper understanding of concepts and methods introduced in the course. The course is primarily aimed as an intense advanced course for undergraduates from diverse backgrounds in the summer term.
 
## Course syllabus
### Topic covered included:
1.    Basic neurobiology of olfactory system in drosophila
2.    Neural encoding model
3.    Neural decoding model
4.    Synapse and network models
5.    Synaptic plasticity and learning
 
### Tutorial materials:
1.    Matlab or Octave tutorials
2.    Sparse coding -- mathematical tutorials
3.    Perceptron model -- mathematical tutorials
4.    Hopfield model – mathematical tutorials

## Recommended background
Be familiar with basic concepts in linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory. Specifically, the ability to understand simple equations involving vectors and matrices, differentiate simple functions, and understand the concept of a probability distribution. For the exercises, some familiarity with Matlab or Octave would be useful. Minimal prior background in neuroscience is required.

## Course format
The course will last 2 weeks (taking place each other day) and will consist of homework assignments and computer implementation of the neural models.
## TA duties
TA will participate in the lecture (~1 hour for each class) and deliver lectures on the tutorial materials (~1 hour for each tutorial). TA will take care of students’ discussion of the course materials (~1 hour for each), grade the students’ performance of assignments (~1 hour for each) and be responsible for computer lab sessions (~2 hour for each).
